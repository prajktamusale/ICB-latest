                                    your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.</p>
                                <p>Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards 
                                    Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.</p>
                                <p>PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its
